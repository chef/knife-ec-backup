      # A failed user
      # => {work_dir}/errors/users/afiune.json
      # A failed cookbook
      # => {work_dir}/errors/cookbooks/burger.json
      # A failed environment
      # => {work_dir}/errors/environment/dev.json
      #
      # The advantages of this schema is the ability to retry the backup or
      # restore and pick up where we left.
